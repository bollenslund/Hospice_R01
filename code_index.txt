year_append.sas:
Takes Claims data files from raw_sas directory and merges 2007-2010
claims into data files by type of claims data (hospice_base, 
hospice_revenue, etc.)


1 Hospice_Claims.sas:
Drops beneficiaries that don't have first claim within Sept 2008 and Nov 2009
Checks for claims that span a single hospice stay and merges claim start and end
dates, costs
Merges all revenue code days by beneficiary
Structures data so there is one line per beneficiary with variables
           for each of their hospice stays
           
2 MB12mosforward.sas:
Processes the master beneficiary summary files to get date of death, demographics and
location.
Determines sample elgibility using medicare parts a and b coverage, hmo status,
and age (age < 64 at end of hospice enrollment year per mbsf)
Creates hospice dataset that is limited to the mbs sample criteria saved as
ccw.final_hs_mb
Creates MBS dataset with hospice stay 1 start and end dates and count of hospice
stays for use in the medpar claims processing (next step) saved as ccw.for_medpar

3 medpar.sas:
Process medpar claims to get two claims datasets:
1. ccw.ip_claims_clean - Inpatient claims which has start/end dates, costs for each 
   inpatient claim. Also contains indicator for hospital death and ICU and ED use 
   for each IP claim
2. ccw.snf - SNF claims with start/end dates and costs for each SNF stay
Then merges the medpar claims with the already processed datasets
3. ccw.final_hs_mb_ip_snf - Hospice, MBS, IP and SNF use information merged into
   single dataset

chronic_conditions.sas:
Collects diagnosis codes from all claims 12 months before the first hopsice
enrollment, then creates indicator variables for each of the chronic conditions






outpat.sas
Process outpatient claims
Get variables for emergency department outpatient visits and outpatietn costs 
aggregated by date - costs during hospice and after hospice

dme_hh_carr.sas
Process remaining claim types to get aggregated costs during and after hospice

deathinfo.sas
Creates a clean date of death variable drawing from the hospice claims, 
mbs file and medpar claims datasets
Merges the dod variable into the ccw.final_mb_cc1 dataset

merging_together.sas:
Creates a single claims dataset with cleaned information from the
hospice claims, mbs file, and all other claim types
this dataset is saved as ccw.final1

countylevelandcost.sas
Starts with raw ahrf dataset, keeps only variables we need, and renames them
for merging in to hospice datasets
File saved is ccw.ahrf

othermerges.sas    ???
Merges ahrf dataset with claims dataset by beneficiary county / state codes
This is not how we want to do this in the final dataset...

hsurvey.sas
Drops unneeded variables from the original hospice survey dataset received
from Melissa in January 2014
Saves a working copy of this hospice survey dataset as working.hsurvey
Merges the survey with the cleaned claims dataset and saves the
combined dataset as ccw.final2
